# Problem Statement

Steam's recommendation system for suggesting new games to users is too generic and does not effectively tailor recommendations to each user's individual preferences. The current system relies on basic metrics like genre, user tags, and popularity to make recommendations. However, this results in many users receiving recommendations for games that are not well aligned with their interests. The lack of personalization leads to low engagement with recommendations and missed opportunities to connect users to new games they would enjoy. An improved recommendation system is needed that takes into account a wider range of factors to model user preferences and provide suggestions tailored to each user's tastes. This more robust approach would increase user satisfaction with recommendations and support discovery of previously undiscovered games that suit each user's preferences.
